Hangman game

Milestone_2

Three variables created: 'word_list' for 5 select fruits, 'word' for a random fruit selected from 'word_list' and 'guess', which is a a single letter inputted by the user.

Guess is checked by conditional statements to ensure that it is 1) a single letter and 2) not a number. 

Milestone_3

A while statement was added to ensure that the game continues if the user incorrectly enters a number or multiple letters/numbers.

Functions were created to simplify code.

Now, the program checks to see if the letter the user inputted was in the random word.

Milestone_4

Hangman class created. No errors produced when running the code.

Milestone_5

Hangman game completed. Lots of code from Milestone 5 was tweaked as the code did not run as expected. A few extras added into the code that was not mentioned on the task so the game runs better. 

Overall, a nice exercise. I struggled most with the 4th milestone, but my weakness is definetly object orientated programming. I find Classes and Functions confusing.
